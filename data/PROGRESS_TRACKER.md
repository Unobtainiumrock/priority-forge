## 🔴 Priority Queue (Cross-Project)

### P0: Critical Path Items

| ID | Task | Project | Status | Notes |
|----|------|---------|--------|-------|
| DATA-001 | Conversion tracking (CVR) | marketplace-design | ❌ not_started | Blocks: eCPM formula incomplete |
| INT-001 | Wire up v̂ᵢₜ from NN to bid calculation | overlap-resolution | ❌ not_started | Blocks: Bidding pipeline |
| INT-002 | Wire up α price ceiling logic | overlap-resolution | ❌ not_started | Blocks: Overpay protection |
| ML-001 | Train with 100K production data | marketplace-design | ⏳ waiting | Blocks: Model accuracy |

### P1: High Priority

| ID | Task | Project | Status | Notes |
|----|------|---------|--------|-------|
| DATA-002 | Add advertiser entity (campaign grouping) | marketplace-design | ❌ not_started | Multi-campaign pacing |
| INT-003 | Full integration test (ad request → auction) | overlap-resolution | ❌ not_started | E2E validation |
| DASH-001 | Chat interface for interpretability | stable-marriage | ❌ not_started | Phase 7.2 |
| STAG-001 | Integration with stable-marriage RTB | stag-hunt | ❌ not_started | Data coalition → auction |

### P2: Medium Priority

| ID | Task | Project | Status | Notes |
|----|------|---------|--------|-------|
| DATA-003 | Device/Geo context (3.2% → 80%+) | marketplace-design | ❌ not_started | User segmentation |
| EXP-001 | Comparative analysis experiments | overlap-resolution | ❌ not_started | Task 4 |
| EKS-001 | Resume EKS deployment | marketplace-design | 🚫 blocked | When ready for prod |

### P3: Lower Priority

| ID | Task | Project | Status | Notes |
|----|------|---------|--------|-------|
| DATA-004 | User embeddings (replace hash) | marketplace-design | ❌ not_started | Personalization |
| ML-002 | Improve Neural Network (direct eCPM) | overlap-resolution | ❌ not_started | Task 5 |
| DASH-002 | Fix chart rendering warnings | stable-marriage | ❌ not_started | Minor polish |

## 📊 Data Collection Roadmap

| Priority | Data Element | Coverage | Impact | Effort |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------|--------|
| 🔴 P0 | Conversions | 0% | CRITICAL GAP - eCPM = P(click) × P(convert|click) × payout | medium |
| 🟠 P1 | Advertiser entity | 0% | Enables cross-campaign budget coordination | low |
| 🟡 P2 | Device/Geo context | 3.2% | Better user segmentation for NN | medium |
| 🟢 P3 | User embeddings | 0% | Replace SHA256 hash with real embeddings | high |

## 📋 Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-08 | Use Go backend, not Python | Performance for hot path |
| 2026-01-08 | REST API, not gRPC-Web | Simplicity for dashboard |
| 2026-01-08 | Pacing at advertiser level | Go backend is source of truth |
| 2026-01-09 | Separate CTR and CVR models | Different training populations |
| 2026-01-09 | Memoized selectors + throttled slider | Performance fix |
| 2026-01-09 | HTTP MCP server with JSON storage | Team rollout capability, simple start with upgrade path to SQLite |
